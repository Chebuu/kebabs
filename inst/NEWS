Change history of package kebabs:
====================================

Version 1.1.9
- inclusion of dense LIBSVM 3.20 for dense kernel matrix support
  to provide a reliable way for training with kernel matrices
- new accessors folds and performance for CrossValidationResult
- removed fold performance from show of CV result
- adaptions for user defined sequence kernel with new export
  isUserDefined, example in inst/examples/UserDefinedKernel
- correction of errors with position offset for position specific
  kernels
- computation of AUC via trapezoidal rule
- changes for auto mode in CV, grid search, model selection
- check for non-negative mixing coefficients in spectrum and
  gappy pair kernel
- build warnings on Windows removed
- added definition of performance parameters for binary
  and multiclass classification to vignette
- update of citation file and reference section in help pages

Version 1.1.8
- new accessors selGridRow, selGridCol and fullModel for class
  ModelSelectionResult
- change of naming of feature weights because of change in
  LiblineaR 1.94-2
- GCC warnings in Linux removed

Version 1.1.7
- change in LiblineaR - upgrade to LIBLINEAR 1.94
  in function LiblineaR the parameter labels was renamed to target
- correction in model selection for performance parameters
- error correction of vector length overflow in sparse explicit
  representation for very large number of sequences in spectrum,
  gappy pair and motif kernel
- error correction for AUC in cross validation
- minor changes in help pages
- minor changes in vignette

Version 1.1.6
- error correction for training with position specific kernel and
  computation of feature weights
- error correction in coercion of kernel to character for distance
  weighting
- error correction in spectrum, gappy pair and motif kernel
  for kernel matrix - last feature was missing in kernel value
  in rare situations
- correction of Windows build problem in linearKernel
- build warnings on Windows removed
- minor changes in help pages
- minor changes in vignette

Version 1.1.5
- new method heatmap to display heatmap of prediction profiles
- extension of function linearKernel to optionally return
  a sparse kernel matrix
- correction of computation of feature weights for
  LiblineaR with more than 3 classes

- correction in subsetting of sparse explicit representation for
  head / tail
- error correction in subsetting of prediction profile
- error correction in mismatch kernel
- check uniqueness of motifs in motif kernel
- minor changes in help pages
- change name of vignette Rnw to lowercase

Version 1.1.4:
- added two help pages

Version 1.1.3
- fix to adapt for changed Biostrings/S4Vectors API

Version 1.1.2
- minor C code changes for mismatch kernel
- correction of MCC
- new class ROCData and new function computeROCandAUC for
  binary classification added
- new plot function for ROCData to plot ROC for binary classes
- AUC as additional performance parameter in cross validation
  and as performance objective in grid search

Version 1.1.1
- correction for cross validation with factor label
- correction for storing prob model in kebabs model for kernlab
- removal of clang warnings for unused functions

Version 1.1.0:
- first devel version created from first official release
  with version 1.0.0
